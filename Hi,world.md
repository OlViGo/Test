# HI

Teftelka is a nice kitten)

I agree with this fact entirely

Make an account on github.com

Make **local** repository

Connect local repository with the **remote** one. Git hub tells us how to do it

**Push** your local repository to github.Perhaps,it is necessary to make **authorization** pnthe remote repository

**Make changes** on the other computer

**Pull**  the actual state from the remote repository to the local one
